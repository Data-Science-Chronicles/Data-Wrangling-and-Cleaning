## Introduction to Data Wrangling
 Data wrangling is the process of transforming and mapping data from one "raw" data form into another format, with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes such as analytics and visualization.
 
## Steps in Data Wrangling and Cleaning
Identifying and handling missing data: Missing data can be identified by looking for null or empty values in the dataset. Once identified, missing data can be handled by either removing the data or imputing (filling in) the missing values.

* Standardizing and consolidating data: Data from multiple sources may be in different formats and may need to be standardized and consolidated into a single dataset. This can involve converting data into a consistent format (e.g. converting all dates into a standard format) and combining data from multiple sources.

* Transforming data: Data may need to be transformed in order to make it usable for analysis. This can include normalizing data (e.g. scaling data so that it falls within a certain range) and creating new features or variables from existing data. Here we also perform enconding.

* Removing outliers: Outliers are data points that are far away from the other data points and may be affecting the analysis negatively. Identifying and removing outliers is crucial for producing accurate and reliable insights from the data.

* Data validation: This step ensure that the data is accurate and consistent by checking for errors, missing values and  inconsistencies such as invalid data types or values that fall outside of expected ranges
* Data integration: This involves combining data from multiple sources, which can be done through techniques such as data mapping and data matching
* Data Export: The final step is to export the cleaned data in a format that can be used for analysis.
** Data export refers to the process of saving the cleaned and transformed data in a format that can be used for analysis. This typically involves saving the data to a file, such as a CSV or Excel file, or exporting it to a database or data warehouse. The choice of format will depend on the specific requirements of the analysis and the tools that will be used to analyze the data.

#### Note: 
Using visual data cleaning and wrangling tools such as **OpenRefine**, **Trifacta**, and **Talend**. These tools provide a user-friendly interface for exploring and cleaning data, and can be useful for dealing with large or complex datasets.

## Data Cleaning Techniques
Data cleaning is the process of identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and missing data in a dataset. This section provides an overview of common data cleaning techniques such as handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and removing duplicates using both R and Python.

## Data Transformation with R and Python
Both R and Python have powerful tools for data manipulation and transformation such as `dplyr` and `pandas`. This section provides examples and tutorials on how to use these packages functions such as `filter()` , `select()` , `group_by()` , `summarize()` , `melt` , `pivot` , `stack` , `unstack ` to subset, manipulate, and summarize data.

## String Manipulation with R and Python
Both R and Python have packages and built-in functions for working with strings, such as stringr and Python's string module, which can be used to clean and manipulate string variables. This section provides examples and tutorials on how to use these functions to manipulate strings.

## Handling Dates and Times with R and Python
Both R and Python have packages and built-in libraries such as lubridate and datetime which provides functions for working with dates and times, such as `ymd()` , `hms()` , `difftime()` , and `datetime.strptime() `, `datetime.strftime()` respectively, which can be used to convert and manipulate date and time variables. This section provides examples and tutorials on how to use these functions to work with dates and times.

## Advanced Data Wrangling with R and Python
Both R and Python have powerful tools and packages for advanced data wrangling such as `data.table` and `pandas` which provides an efficient and flexible data manipulation tool, similar to `dplyr`, but with improved performance when working with large datasets. This section provides examples and tutorials on how to use these packages for advanced data wrangling tasks.

## Case Studies and Examples
This section provides examples of real-world data wrangling and cleaning projects using both R and Python, along with a detailed explanation of the techniques used to clean and transform the data.

## Conclusion
Data wrangling and cleaning are essential steps in the data science process. By following the tutorials and examples provided in this section, you will gain a solid understanding of how to clean and transform data using both R and Python programming languages. We hope you find this section helpful and informative. Happy wrangling!
